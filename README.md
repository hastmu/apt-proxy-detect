# apt-proxy-detect
Auto detection of apt proxies in the LAN, caching and checking status of it.

# Why this is needed?
Spending 2023 time on this topic sound/reads quite strange but up to now
i struggle with some problem within the solutions i found so far.

Issues:
* No reliable detect proxies via mDns. (Timeouts, not found)
* No caching of the found proxies.
* No check if the found proxy works for the requested target.
* No longer active maintained (deprecated warnings all over the place)

# How does it look?

Example output:
```
dev@dev:~$ apt-proxy-detect.sh 
Service[ER][apt-cacher-ng proxy on squid-deb-proxy]@http://192.168.0.27:3142 
Service[OK][Squid deb proxy on squid-deb-proxy]@http://192.168.0.27:8000 
http://192.168.0.27:8000
```

or with specific checking (failing):
```
dev@dev:~$ apt-proxy-detect.sh github.xyz
Service[ER][apt-cacher-ng proxy on squid-deb-proxy]@http://192.168.0.27:3142 
Service[ER][Squid deb proxy on squid-deb-proxy]@http://192.168.0.27:8000 
```

# How to install?

will follow next days...
